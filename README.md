# Code Refactor Project
This project was created in order to learn about basic HTML, CSS, and GIT. I took starter code and refactored it to add semantic, structured HTML elements, a title, and alt image attributes. I started with base code that needed to be modified, and made the necessary adjustments. I had to create a remote repo for the project and utilize git bash to commit and push the cloned files to my remote repository labeled "Meticulous Marsupials."
